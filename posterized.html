    <div class="poster-desc">This poster for the 105th National High School Baseball Championship (Koshien) presents a <b>ghostly, emotional</b> image of a baseball player captured mid-fall or in a moment of emotional release. The <b>sepia-toned, textured</b> visual and traditional Japanese typography evoke nostalgia, transience, and poetic reverence. It feels like a visual elegy—an homage to both the sport and the spirit of youth.</div>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Line</h3>
  <p>
    Lines are mostly <b>soft and blurred</b>, due to the aged, photographic texture.<br>
    <b>Implied diagonal lines</b> through the figure’s limbs and uniform suggest motion and collapse.<br>
    <b>Vertical calligraphic lines of text</b> contrast the blurred imagery with precise strokes.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Shape</h3>
  <p>
    The main shape is the <b>organic form of the athlete</b>, isolated in a nearly abstract space.<br>
    Background texture forms <b>circular and irregular patterns</b>, resembling water, dust, or time-worn surfaces.<br>
    Shapes are <b>undefined and dissolve</b> into the background, reinforcing the fading memory aesthetic.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Form</h3>
  <p>
    The figure has a <b>semi-modeled form</b> due to lighting and grain.<br>
    Dimensionality is suggested by <b>shadow and soft light</b>, not sharp edges.<br>
    Form appears <b>ephemeral</b>, like it's disintegrating into the background.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Color</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Monochrome sepia tones</b> dominate—brown, cream, and soft black.<br>
    The color choice emphasizes <b>nostalgia, dignity, and solemnity</b>.<br>
    <b>Absence of bright color</b> reinforces the historic and emotional tone.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Value</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Mid-to-low contrast</b> image with a few deeper shadows (e.g., cap, shoes).<br>
    <b>Value gradients</b> add softness and a dreamlike atmosphere.<br>
    Typography, however, provides <b>high-value contrast</b> for readability.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Texture</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Extremely grainy and mottled texture</b>, resembling old paper or corroded film.<br>
    The visual surface feels <b>tactile and timeworn</b>, almost fossilized.<br>
    Texture plays a <b>central emotional role</b>, implying memory and erosion.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Space</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Shallow spatial depth</b>—figure floats without ground or horizon.<br>
    Space feels <b>liminal and suspended</b>, evoking a sense of timelessness.<br>
    <b>Sparse composition and blurred background</b> isolate the emotional core.
  </p>
