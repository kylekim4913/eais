    <div class="poster-desc">This poster presents a <b>minimal, gestural ink illustration</b> of a nude figure with bold, fluid strokes. The act of <b>flowers</b> bursting from the mouth introduces metaphor and surrealism. Combining expressive body language with handwritten and calligraphic elements, the design speaks to <b>sensuality, expression,</b> and cultural duality, as emphasized by the mix of English and East Asian characters.</div>

  <h3>Line</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Bold, flowing brush lines</b> define the entire composition.<br>
    <b>Curves</b> express motion and emotion, particularly in the figure’s posture and the flower burst.<br>
    Variations in line thickness contribute to a sense of <b>rhythm and gesture</b>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Shape</h3>
  <p>
    The figure is rendered through <b>contour-based organic shapes</b>.<br>
    Flowers scatter in <b>loose, textured dots</b> forming an abstract shape of emission.<br>
    <b>Letterforms</b> (both Latin and Chinese) add structured contrast through square and vertical shapes.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Form</h3>
  <p>
    Entirely <b>flat composition</b>; volume is suggested only through contour flow.<br>
    <b>Form is abstracted</b>—no light or shadow modeling.<br>
    <b>Emotional form</b> comes from posture and visual symbolism, not realism.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Color</h3>
  <p>
    Strictly <b>black on white</b>, invoking ink painting or calligraphy traditions.<br>
    The <b>absence of color</b> draws attention to line quality and symbolic meaning.<br>
    <b>Monochrome</b> enhances emotional directness and aesthetic discipline.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Value</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Binary value system</b>—black ink and white negative space.<br>
    No tonal gradation, relying solely on <b>contrast</b> for definition.<br>
    <b>High value contrast</b> makes each stroke immediate and bold.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Texture</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Brushwork</b> shows dry-brush effects, hinting at paper texture and hand-drawn origin.<br>
    The flowers have a <b>splattered ink texture</b>, offering tactile variation.<br>
    Texture is <b>expressive</b>, evoking traditional ink-wash or Zen aesthetics.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Space</h3>
  <p>
    Ample<b>white space</b>surrounds and frames the figure, enhancing focus and breathing room.<br>
    <b>Negative space</b> defines body contours and suggests openness.<br>
    Space is <b>flat but intentional</b>, following visual balance principles from calligraphic design.
