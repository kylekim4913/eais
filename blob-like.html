    <div class="poster-desc">This poster for "Romantic Route 3" features a <b>playful and surreal 3D form,</b> resembling a soft, abstract object (perhaps inspired by a road or fruit) decorated with stylized starbursts. The inclusion of a tiny van and fluffy green trees adds a <b>miniature world-building aspect,</b> emphasizing whimsy and imagination. It combines <b>CGI realism with graphic flatness,</b> merging sculpture and signage.</div>

  <h3>Line</h3>
  <p>
    Lines are mostly <b>implied through form contours</b> and object intersections.<br>
    The <b>spiky white star shapes</b> serve as graphic contrast to the smooth curves.<br>
    Subtle surface shading also suggests <b>curved boundary lines</b>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Shape</h3>
  <p>
    Dominant shape is a <b>double-lobed, organic 3D form</b>—possibly referencing a hill or fruit.<br>
    Repeated <b>explosion/starburst icons</b> provide visual rhythm and graphic punctuation.<br>
    Small vehicle and <b>circular trees</b> offer varied shape contrast in scale and texture.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Form</h3>
  <p>
    Strong sense of <b>three-dimensional form</b> with soft modeling, shadowing, and highlight.<br>
    The main form appears <b>plush or rubbery</b>—bulging and tactile.<br>
    <b>Form is central</b> to the poster’s surreal appeal and storytelling.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Color</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Bold, high-saturation color scheme:</b> orange object, bright blue background, green trees, and white accents.<br>
    Colors are <b>cheerful and fantastical</b>, enhancing the imaginative tone.<br>
    <b>Strong contrasts</b> help isolate elements for readability and vibrancy.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Value</h3>
  <p>
    Subtle <b>value transitions</b> across the orange form suggest depth and curvature.<br>
    Background and graphic symbols rely on <b>flat high-contrast values</b>.<br>
    Value contrast <b>emphasizes dimensionality</b> without sacrificing clarity.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Texture</h3>
  <p>
    The main object has a slightly <b>dimpled or rubbery surface</b>, visible in light reflections.<br>
    <b>Green trees appear fuzzy</b>, like miniature modeling materials.<br>
    Texture adds <b>realism</b> to the otherwise surreal scene.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <h3>Space</h3>
  <p>
    The scene sits in <b>shallow but implied space</b>, with no perspective depth beyond the object.<br>
    Miniature trees and vehicle imply a <b>microscale environment</b>, giving narrative dimension.<br>
    Background is <b>flat and clean</b>, focusing attention on the floating sculpture.
  </p>
